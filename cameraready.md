    <h2>Step 1: Add the IEEE Copyright Notice to Your Manuscript</h2>
    Before Creating a PDF add the copyright notice to your source document. The
    appropriate copyright clearance code notice is to appear on the bottom of the
    first page of your paper according to the guidelines set forth in the
    Cataloging/Copyright Instructions for an IEEE Conference Proceeding. Detailed
    instructions can be found at:

    [https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/index.html](https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/index.html){:target="_blank"}

    * For papers in which all authors are employed by the US government, the copyright notice is: **U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright**

    * For papers in which all authors are employed by a Crown government (UK, Canada, and Australia), the copyright notice is: **978-1-6654-2614-5/21/$31.00 ©2021 Crown**

    <p>Tips for adding the IEEE copyright notice to your pdf:</p>
    * You may want to first prepare your pdf, and then add the IEEE copyright notice separately using a pdf editing program. You can then re-print the document in pdf format and then validate it using IEEE PDF eXpress.

    * If you are preparing your paper in LaTeX and you are using the IEEEtran document class, this is an example that may help:
      - Add the following code before the \maketitle command:
        * \IEEEoverridecommandlockouts
        * \IEEEpubid{\makebox[\columnwidth]{978-1-6654-2614-5/21/$31.00~\copyright2021 IEEE \hfill} \hspace{\columnsep}\makebox[\columnwidth]{ }}
    * Make sure you use the appropriate IEEE copyright notice string, as explained above.

    <p>If necessary, contact Nicola Bombieri Nicola.bombieri@univr.it for the appropriate copyright notice.</p>
