    <h2>Thank you for participating in VLSI-SoC 2021 virtual conference</h2>
    During the VLSI-SoC 2021 conference, all the technical sessions will be
    live. Therefore, every presenter must be online, give her/his talk by sharing
    the presentation, and participate in the Q&A session. We also ask each speaker
    to provide a pre-recorded video. The latter will be used in case of technical
    problems during the live session.
    We understand this calls for a special effort, but we firmly believe is the best
    way to enjoy the event, exchange new ideas, and promote discussions.
    More detailed instructions on how to join the live virtual sessions will be sent
    to all the speakers and attendees during the forthcoming weeks.
    The following is a complete guide to preparing the visual material.

    <h2>Presentation format</h2>
    Technical papers: Each presentation will consist of a 15 min live slide show
    followed by 3 min of Q&A (the pre-recorded video must be of the same duration
    15 min).


    Technical Poster: Each poster presentation will consist of a 10 min live slide
    show followed by 2 min of Q&A (the pre-recorded video must be of the same
    duration 10 min).


    Ph.D. Forum: Presenters will receive a dedicated set of instructions.
